# Comments and Documentation

Well-documented code is essential for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. In this section, we'll learn how to effectively document Python code using comments and docstrings.

## Comments in Python

Comments are notes that you add to your code to explain what it does. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.

### Single-Line Comments

In Python, single-line comments start with the `#` character:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # This is an inline comment
```

### Multi-Line Comments

Python doesn't have a dedicated syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages (e.g., `/* */` in C/Java). However, you can use multiple consecutive single-line comments:

```python
# This is a multi-line comment
# that spans across multiple
# lines of code
```

Or you can use a multi-line string (triple quotes) that isn't assigned to any variable:

```python
"""
This is not technically a comment, but an unassigned string literal.
It behaves like a multi-line comment since it's not assigned to any variable.
The Python interpreter will ignore it during execution.
"""
```

### Effective Commenting Practices

#### Do Comment:

- **Complex algorithms**: Explain the purpose and logic of complex code
- **Non-obvious solutions**: Clarify why you chose a particular approach
- **Workarounds**: Document hacks or workarounds for specific issues
- **Future improvements**: Note areas for future enhancement (using `# TODO: ...`)

```python
# Calculate the Fibonacci number at position n using dynamic programming
# This approach has O(n) time complexity, which is more efficient than recursion
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    fib = [0, 1]
    
    # Build up the sequence iteratively
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    
    return fib[n]

# TODO: Add memoization to improve performance for repeated calls
```

#### Don't Comment:

- **Obvious code**: Don't state what is already clear from the code
- **Outdated information**: Always update comments when you change code
- **Dead code**: Delete unused code rather than commenting it out long-term

```python
# Bad comment example - states the obvious
x = x + 1  # Increment x by 1

# Better - no comment needed for simple operations
x = x + 1
```

## Docstrings

Docstrings are string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, class, or module. Unlike regular comments, docstrings are accessible at runtime via the `__doc__` attribute.

### Module Docstrings

Module docstrings appear at the beginning of a file:

```python
"""
Math Utilities Module

This module provides utility functions for common 
mathematical operations not available in the standard math module.
"""

import math

# Module code goes here...
```

### Function Docstrings

Function docstrings describe what a function does, its parameters, and return values:

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle.
    
    Parameters:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle
        
    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle
    
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_area(2)
        12.56637...
    """
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
```

### Class Docstrings

Class docstrings document the class's purpose and behavior:

```python
class Person:
    """
    A class representing a person.
    
    Attributes:
        name (str): The person's name
        age (int): The person's age
        address (str, optional): The person's address
    
    Methods:
        greet: Return a greeting message
        is_adult: Check if the person is an adult
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name, age, address=None):
        """
        Initialize a Person object.
        
        Parameters:
            name (str): The person's name
            age (int): The person's age
            address (str, optional): The person's address
        """
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address
```

## Docstring Styles

There are several common styles for writing docstrings in Python:

### Google Style

```python
def divide(dividend, divisor):
    """Divides the dividend by the divisor.
    
    Args:
        dividend (int): The number being divided
        divisor (int): The number dividing the dividend
        
    Returns:
        float: The quotient of the division
        
    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If divisor is 0
    
    Examples:
        >>> divide(10, 2)
        5.0
    """
    return dividend / divisor
```

### reStructuredText (Sphinx) Style

```python
def divide(dividend, divisor):
    """Divides the dividend by the divisor.
    
    :param dividend: The number being divided
    :type dividend: int
    :param divisor: The number dividing the dividend
    :type divisor: int
    :returns: The quotient of the division
    :rtype: float
    :raises ZeroDivisionError: If divisor is 0
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> divide(10, 2)
        5.0
    """
    return dividend / divisor
```

### NumPy/SciPy Style

```python
def divide(dividend, divisor):
    """Divides the dividend by the divisor.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    dividend : int
        The number being divided
    divisor : int
        The number dividing the dividend
        
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The quotient of the division
        
    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        If divisor is 0
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> divide(10, 2)
    5.0
    """
    return dividend / divisor
```

## Accessing Docstrings

Docstrings can be accessed programmatically through the `__doc__` attribute or the `help()` function:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message for the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Access the docstring
print(greet.__doc__)  # Output: Return a greeting message for the given name.

# Get help information
help(greet)  # Shows formatted documentation
```

## Documentation Tools

### Python's Built-in Help System

Python's built-in `help()` function displays documentation for objects:

```python
help(str)  # Show documentation for the string class
help(list.append)  # Show documentation for the list.append method
```

### External Documentation Tools

Several tools can generate documentation from your docstrings:

- **Sphinx**: A powerful documentation generator often used for Python projects
- **pdoc**: A simple tool for auto-generating API documentation
- **MkDocs**: Documentation site generator with support for Python docstrings
- **Pycco**: Generates side-by-side code and documentation

## Type Hints

Python 3.5+ supports type annotations, which can enhance documentation by explicitly stating the expected types:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
    
    Parameters:
        numbers: A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        The average value
        
    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If the list is empty
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

Type hints don't affect how Python runs your code but can be used by:
- Static type checkers like mypy
- IDEs for better auto-completion and error detection
- Documentation generators

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Write documentation as you code**, not after
2. **Update documentation when you change code**
3. **Use consistent style** throughout your project
4. **Document why, not just what** the code does
5. **Include examples** demonstrating how to use functions and classes
6. **Document exceptions** your code might raise
7. **Keep it concise but complete**
8. **Use type hints** to clarify expected types

## Code Documentation in Project Development

### Documentation for Personal Projects

Even for personal projects, good documentation helps:
- Remind yourself how your code works when you return to it later
- Provide a reference for functions and classes you've created
- Make it easier to debug issues

### Documentation for Team Projects

For collaborative projects, documentation is crucial for:
- Onboarding new team members
- Ensuring consistent understanding of how components work
- Reducing time spent answering basic questions
- Maintaining knowledge when team members leave

### Documentation for Open Source Projects

For open source projects, thorough documentation:
- Makes your project more accessible to new users
- Reduces support burden by providing clear instructions
- Encourages contributions by making the codebase more understandable

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned about Python's basic syntax, data types, I/O operations, and documentation practices, you have a solid foundation in Python programming. In the next chapter, we'll explore control flow and looping constructs, which will enable you to create more dynamic and responsive programs.

## Practice Exercises

1. Add appropriate comments to the following code to explain what it does:
   ```python
   def process_data(data):
       result = []
       for item in data:
           if isinstance(item, (int, float)):
               result.append(item * 2)
           elif isinstance(item, str):
               if item.isdigit():
                   result.append(int(item) * 2)
               else:
                   result.append(item.upper())
       return result
   ```

2. Write a well-documented function called `calculate_statistics` that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, minimum, and maximum values.

3. Create a class called `BankAccount` with appropriate methods and attributes. Use docstrings to document the class, its attributes, and its methods.

4. Examine a Python module from the standard library (e.g., `random`, `math`, `datetime`) and review its documentation. Write down three things you learned from the documentation that you didn't know before.

5. Take a poorly documented function and improve its documentation by adding a clear docstring, type hints, and comments where necessary:
   ```python
   def proc(x, y, z=None):
       if z is None:
           z = []
       z.append(x + y)
       return sum(z) / len(z)
   ```
