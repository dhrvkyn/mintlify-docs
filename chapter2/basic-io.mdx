# Basic I/O

Input and Output (I/O) operations are fundamental to programming. They allow your program to interact with users, files, and other systems. In this section, we'll focus on basic console I/O - getting input from users and displaying output on the screen.

## Output with `print()`

The `print()` function is the most common way to display output in Python.

### Basic Usage

```python
print("Hello, Python Mastery!")  # Prints: Hello, Python Mastery!

# Printing variables
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(name)      # Prints: Alice
print(age)       # Prints: 30

# Printing multiple items
print(name, age)  # Prints: Alice 30
```

### Print Formatting

The `print()` function can format output in various ways:

```python
# Print with a custom separator
print("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", sep=", ")  # Prints: Apple, Banana, Cherry

# Print with a custom end character (default is newline)
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")  # Prints: Hello World

# Printing with tabs and newlines
print("Name:\tAlice\nAge:\t30")
# Prints:
# Name:   Alice
# Age:    30
```

### Escape Sequences

Escape sequences allow you to include special characters in strings:

| Escape Sequence | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| `\n` | Newline |
| `\t` | Tab |
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\'` | Single quote |
| `\"` | Double quote |
| `\r` | Carriage return |
| `\b` | Backspace |

```python
print("Line 1\nLine 2")  # Prints two lines
print("Hello\tWorld")    # Prints with a tab between words
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")  # Prints quotes within a string
```

### Printing Variables with Text

There are several ways to combine text and variables in output:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Using + operator (string concatenation)
print("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + str(age))  # Note the str() conversion

# Using multiple arguments
print("Name:", name, ", Age:", age)

# Using f-strings (Python 3.6+, recommended)
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

# Using str.format()
print("Name: {}, Age: {}".format(name, age))
print("Name: {n}, Age: {a}".format(n=name, a=age))

# Using % operator (older style)
print("Name: %s, Age: %d" % (name, age))
```

### Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

F-strings (introduced in Python 3.6) are the most concise and readable way to format strings:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.8

# Basic formatting
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}")

# Expression evaluation
print(f"Next year, {name} will be {age + 1} years old")

# Number formatting
pi = 3.14159265359
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")  # 3.14

# Width and alignment
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2} squared is {i*i:3}")

# Datetime formatting
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(f"Current date: {now:%Y-%m-%d}")
```

### Pretty Printing

For complex data structures, you can use the `pprint` module for more readable output:

```python
import pprint

complex_data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "friends": ["Bob", "Charlie", "Dave"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zip": "12345"
    },
    "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "programming"]
}

# Standard print
print(complex_data)

# Pretty print
pprint.pprint(complex_data)
```

## Input with `input()`

The `input()` function allows your program to receive text input from the user.

### Basic Usage

```python
# Basic input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# The input function always returns a string
age_str = input("Enter your age: ")
print(f"Next year, you'll be {int(age_str) + 1} years old")

# Convert input to the appropriate type
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))
print(f"Your height in centimeters: {height * 100}")
```

### Input Validation

It's important to validate user input to prevent errors:

```python
# Simple validation
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        if age < 0 or age > 120:
            print("Please enter a valid age between 0 and 120")
            continue
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a number")

print(f"You entered: {age}")
```

### Handling Multiple Inputs

You can handle multiple inputs in various ways:

```python
# Multiple inputs on separate lines
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Multiple inputs on a single line
x, y = input("Enter two numbers separated by a space: ").split()
x, y = int(x), int(y)
print(f"Sum: {x + y}")

# Multiple inputs with specific separator
values = input("Enter values separated by commas: ").split(",")
print(f"You entered {len(values)} values")
```

## Command Line Arguments

Python programs can accept arguments from the command line using the `sys.argv` list:

```python
import sys

# The first element (sys.argv[0]) is the script name
print(f"Script name: {sys.argv[0]}")

# Remaining elements are the arguments
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    print(f"Arguments: {sys.argv[1:]}")
else:
    print("No arguments provided")
```

For example, if you run `python script.py arg1 arg2`, then:
- `sys.argv[0]` would be `script.py`
- `sys.argv[1]` would be `arg1`
- `sys.argv[2]` would be `arg2`

### Using argparse for Command Line Arguments

For more complex command-line interfaces, the `argparse` module provides powerful tools:

```python
import argparse

# Create the parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.')

# Add arguments
parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+',
                    help='an integer for the accumulator')
parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const',
                    const=sum, default=max,
                    help='sum the integers (default: find the max)')

# Parse arguments
args = parser.parse_args()

# Use the arguments
result = args.accumulate(args.integers)
print(result)
```

## Reading and Writing Files

File I/O is a common operation in many programs. Python makes it easy to read from and write to files.

### Opening and Closing Files

The `open()` function is used to open files:

```python
# Open a file for reading (default mode is 'r')
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Always close files when you're done with them
file.close()
```

It's better to use a context manager (`with` statement) to automatically close files:

```python
# Using with statement (recommended)
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # File operations here
    contents = file.read()
    
# File is automatically closed when the block exits
```

### Common File Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `'r'` | Read (default) |
| `'w'` | Write (creates new file or truncates existing file) |
| `'a'` | Append (adds to end of file) |
| `'b'` | Binary mode (used with other modes: `'rb'`, `'wb'`) |
| `'t'` | Text mode (default, used with other modes: `'rt'`, `'wt'`) |
| `'+'` | Update mode (reading and writing) |

### Reading from Files

There are several ways to read from files:

```python
# Read the entire file as a string
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)

# Read line by line
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    line = file.readline()  # Read a single line
    lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines into a list

# Iterate through the file line by line (memory efficient)
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes the newline character
```

### Writing to Files

Writing to files is straightforward:

```python
# Write a string to a file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python Mastery!\n")
    file.write("This is a second line.\n")

# Write multiple lines at once
lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

### Appending to Files

To add content to existing files without overwriting:

```python
# Append to a file
with open('log.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("New log entry\n")
```

### Working with Binary Files

For non-text files (images, audio, etc.), use binary mode:

```python
# Reading a binary file
with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as file:
    image_data = file.read()

# Writing to a binary file
with open('output.jpg', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(image_data)
```

## Standard Streams

Python provides three standard streams:

1. **Standard Input (stdin)**: For reading input
2. **Standard Output (stdout)**: For normal output
3. **Standard Error (stderr)**: For error messages

These can be accessed via the `sys` module:

```python
import sys

# Write to stdout
sys.stdout.write("This is standard output\n")

# Write to stderr
sys.stderr.write("This is error output\n")

# Read from stdin
input_line = sys.stdin.readline()
```

## Redirecting Output to Files

You can redirect print output to files:

```python
# Redirect print output to a file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    print("This will be written to the file", file=file)
    print("This is another line", file=file)
```

## String I/O

For cases where you need file-like operations on strings, the `io` module provides the `StringIO` class:

```python
import io

# Create a StringIO object
string_io = io.StringIO()

# Write to the StringIO object
string_io.write("Hello, ")
string_io.write("World!")

# Get the value
output = string_io.getvalue()  # "Hello, World!"

# Read from a StringIO object
input_string = io.StringIO("Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3")
for line in input_string:
    print(line.strip())

# Always close the StringIO object when done
string_io.close()
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand basic input and output operations in Python, you're ready to create interactive programs that can communicate with users and handle files. In the next section, we'll explore how to document your code effectively using comments and docstrings.

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color, then displays a formatted message including all this information.

2. Create a simple calculator program that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /), then performs the calculation and displays the result.

3. Write a program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

4. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers (separated by spaces), then writes the numbers, their squares, and their cubes to a file in a neatly formatted table.

5. Write a program that copies a text file, but converts all text to uppercase. The original and destination filenames should be provided as command-line arguments.
