# Loop Control

In the previous section, we explored the basic looping constructs in Python. Now, we'll dive deeper into techniques for controlling loop execution flow. These techniques give you finer control over how your loops behave, allowing you to create more efficient and elegant solutions.

## The `break` Statement

The `break` statement immediately terminates the current loop and continues execution at the next statement after the loop.

### Basic Usage

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when i equals 5
    print(i)

print("Loop ended")
```

This will output:
```
1
2
3
4
Loop ended
```

The loop stops as soon as `i` reaches 5, without executing the print statement for that iteration.

### Practical Applications

#### Early Exit from Search

```python
def find_index(items, target):
    """Find the index of target in items, or return -1 if not found."""
    for index, item in enumerate(items):
        if item == target:
            return index  # Found the item, exit the function (and the loop)
    return -1  # Item not found
```

#### User Input Validation

```python
while True:
    password = input("Enter a password (minimum 8 characters): ")
    if len(password) >= 8:
        print("Password accepted!")
        break
    print("Password too short, try again.")
```

#### Limiting Iterations

```python
# Limit the number of attempts to find a solution
max_attempts = 100
attempt = 0

while attempt < max_attempts:
    attempt += 1
    # Try to find a solution
    if found_solution():
        print(f"Solution found after {attempt} attempts")
        break
    
if attempt == max_attempts:
    print("Failed to find solution within the limit")
```

## The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves on to the next iteration.

### Basic Usage

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)
```

This will output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

The print statement is skipped whenever `i` is an even number.

### Practical Applications

#### Filtering Data

```python
def process_positive_numbers(numbers):
    """Process only positive numbers from a list."""
    for num in numbers:
        if num <= 0:
            continue  # Skip non-positive numbers
        
        # Process the positive number
        result = num ** 2
        print(f"Processed {num} -> {result}")
```

#### Input Validation in a Loop

```python
valid_entries = []

while len(valid_entries) < 5:
    entry = input("Enter a positive number: ")
    
    # Skip non-numeric entries
    if not entry.isdigit():
        print("That's not a number, try again.")
        continue
    
    # Convert to number and validate
    number = int(entry)
    if number <= 0:
        print("Please enter a positive number.")
        continue
    
    # If we get here, the entry is valid
    valid_entries.append(number)

print("Valid entries:", valid_entries)
```

#### Skipping Problematic Items

```python
def process_files(filenames):
    """Process multiple files, skipping any that don't exist."""
    for filename in filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
                content = file.read()
                # Process file content
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Skipping {filename}: File not found")
            continue
        
        print(f"Processed {filename}")
```

## Nested Loops and Control Statements

Control statements like `break` and `continue` only affect the innermost loop that contains them.

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 1:
            break  # This only breaks out of the inner loop
        print(f"({i}, {j})", end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each inner loop (complete or broken)
```

This will output:
```
(0, 0) 
(1, 0) 
(2, 0) 
```

### Breaking Out of Nested Loops

If you need to break out of multiple nested loops, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Using a flag variable

```python
found = False
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        if condition(i, j):
            found = True
            break  # Break the inner loop
    if found:
        break  # Break the outer loop
```

#### Option 2: Using a function

```python
def search_grid():
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if condition(i, j):
                return (i, j)  # Exit both loops by returning
    return None  # Not found

result = search_grid()
```

#### Option 3: Using exceptions (less common)

```python
try:
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if condition(i, j):
                raise StopIteration  # Raise an exception to break all loops
except StopIteration:
    pass  # Catch the exception and continue execution
```

## The `else` Clause in Loops

Both `for` and `while` loops can have an optional `else` clause. The code in the `else` block executes after the loop completes normally (without encountering a `break` statement).

### Basic Usage

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed without breaks")
```

This will output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
Loop completed without breaks
```

If a `break` statement executes inside the loop, the `else` block is skipped:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("This won't be printed because break was called")
```

This will output:
```
0
1
2
```

### Practical Applications

#### Search Algorithms

```python
def find_item(items, target):
    """Check if target exists in items."""
    for item in items:
        if item == target:
            print(f"Found {target}!")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{target} not found in the list")
```

#### Validation Loops

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False  # Not prime, divisible by i
    else:
        return True  # Prime, not divisible by any number
```

#### Ensuring All Items Are Processed

```python
def process_all_items(items):
    """Process all items, unless an error occurs."""
    for item in items:
        if not validate(item):
            print(f"Invalid item: {item}")
            break
        process(item)
    else:
        print("All items processed successfully")
```

## Common Loop Patterns

Let's explore some common patterns that use loop control statements effectively.

### Finding the First Matching Item

```python
def find_first_matching(items, condition):
    for item in items:
        if condition(item):
            return item  # Return the first match and exit
    return None  # No matches found
```

### Processing Items Until a Condition Is Met

```python
def process_until_threshold(values, threshold):
    total = 0
    for value in values:
        total += value
        if total >= threshold:
            break  # Stop once threshold is reached
    return total
```

### Skipping Items That Meet a Condition

```python
def process_except_negative(numbers):
    results = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            continue  # Skip negative numbers
        results.append(process(num))
    return results
```

### Early Exit with Success or Failure

```python
def validate_all(items, validator):
    for item in items:
        if not validator(item):
            return False  # Exit with failure on first invalid item
    return True  # All items are valid
```

## Advanced Loop Control Techniques

### Using `enumerate` with `break` and `continue`

```python
def find_position(items, target):
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        if item == target:
            return i  # Return the position
        if item > target:  # Assuming items is sorted
            break  # Early exit if we've gone past where target would be
    return -1  # Not found
```

### Using `zip` with Loop Control

```python
def find_first_pair_sum(list1, list2, target_sum):
    for x, y in zip(list1, list2):
        current_sum = x + y
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            return (x, y)  # Return the first pair that sums to target_sum
        if current_sum > target_sum:  # Assuming lists are sorted
            break  # Early exit
    return None  # No matching pair found
```

### Handling Special Cases at the Beginning or End

```python
def process_with_special_cases(items):
    if not items:
        return []  # Handle empty list case
    
    results = []
    
    # Handle first item separately if needed
    first_item = items[0]
    if special_condition(first_item):
        results.append(special_process(first_item))
    else:
        results.append(regular_process(first_item))
    
    # Process middle items
    for item in items[1:-1]:
        results.append(regular_process(item))
    
    # Handle last item separately if needed
    if len(items) > 1:
        last_item = items[-1]
        if special_condition(last_item):
            results.append(special_process(last_item))
        else:
            results.append(regular_process(last_item))
    
    return results
```

## Best Practices for Loop Control

1. **Use `break` and `continue` judiciously**
   - Too many control flow modifications can make code harder to follow
   - Consider refactoring complex loops into smaller functions

2. **Prefer positive conditions when possible**
   ```python
   # Less clear
   for item in items:
       if not is_valid(item):
           continue
       process(item)
   
   # More clear
   for item in items:
       if is_valid(item):
           process(item)
   ```

3. **Use clear names for flag variables**
   ```python
   found_match = False
   for item in items:
       if item == target:
           found_match = True
           break
   
   if found_match:
       print("Match found")
   ```

4. **Consider using functions for complex loop logic**
   - Functions make the code more modular and easier to understand
   - They also allow you to exit multiple loops with a simple `return`

5. **Use the `else` clause when it enhances readability**
   - It's most useful for search operations and validations
   - If the logic is complex, consider alternative approaches

6. **Be cautious with nested loops and multiple control statements**
   - Nested loops with multiple breaks and continues can be hard to follow
   - Consider refactoring into helper functions or using different algorithms

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Infinite Loops

Always ensure that `while` loops have a way to terminate:

```python
# Potential infinite loop
while user_input != "quit":
    user_input = input("> ")  # If input() fails, this could loop forever

# Better approach - add a safety check
max_attempts = 100
attempts = 0
while user_input != "quit" and attempts < max_attempts:
    attempts += 1
    try:
        user_input = input("> ")
    except:
        break  # Exit on input failure
```

### Forgetting to Update Loop Variables

```python
# Infinite loop - i never changes
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    # Forgot to increment i

# Correct version
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### Modifying Collections During Iteration

```python
# Problematic - modifying the list while iterating
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in items:
    if item % 2 == 0:
        items.remove(item)  # This can cause items to be skipped

# Better approach - create a new list
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
filtered_items = []
for item in items:
    if item % 2 != 0:
        filtered_items.append(item)

# Or use a list comprehension
filtered_items = [item for item in items if item % 2 != 0]
```

### Breaking Out of the Wrong Loop

```python
# Might not behave as expected
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Outer loop: {i}")
    for j in range(5):
        if condition(i, j):
            break  # This only breaks the inner loop
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've mastered loop control techniques, you're ready to write more efficient and elegant loops in your Python programs. In the next section, we'll explore practical exercises that will help you apply these concepts to real-world problems.

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a program that finds the first prime number greater than a number provided by the user. Use a `while` loop with a `break` statement.

2. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers until the first negative number is encountered. Use a `for` loop with a `break` statement.

3. Write a program that reads a list of words and prints all words that start with a vowel, skipping words that start with a consonant. Use a `for` loop with `continue`.

4. Create a function that searches for a specific value in a 2D grid (a list of lists). Return the coordinates (row, column) if found, or `None` if not found. Use nested loops with a `break`.

5. Implement a function that validates a password. The password should be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. Use a combination of loops and `if` statements with `break` and `continue` to perform the validation efficiently.

6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter positive numbers to add to a sum. If the user enters a negative number, it should be ignored (use `continue`). If the user enters 0, the program should stop asking for numbers (use `break`) and display the final sum.

7. Create a function `is_all_unique(items)` that checks if all items in a list are unique. Use a loop with `else` to handle the case when all items have been checked and no duplicates were found.
