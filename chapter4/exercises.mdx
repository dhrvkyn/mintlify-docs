# Chapter 4: Data Structures - Exercises

This set of exercises is designed to help you master Python's built-in data structures. By completing these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and comprehensions, and learn how to choose the right data structure for different scenarios.

## Basic Data Structure Manipulation

### Exercise 1: List Operations

Write a program that performs the following operations on a list:

1. Create a list of the first 10 square numbers (1, 4, 9, ..., 100)
2. Add the next square number to the end of the list
3. Insert the square of 0 at the beginning of the list
4. Remove the 5th element of the list
5. Sort the list in descending order
6. Create a new list containing only the even square numbers from the original list

```python

```

### Exercise 2: Tuple Manipulation

Given a tuple of months: `months = ('January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December')`, write a program that:

1. Prints the first quarter (first three months)
2. Prints the last quarter (last three months)
3. Prints all months whose names contain the letter 'r'
4. Creates a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the month name and its length
5. Counts how many months have exactly 5 letters in their name

```python

```

### Exercise 3: Dictionary Basics

Create a dictionary that maps country names to their capitals. Include at least 5 countries. Then:

1. Add a new country-capital pair to the dictionary
2. Update the capital of one of the existing countries
3. Remove a country-capital pair
4. Check if a specific country is in the dictionary
5. Create a new dictionary where the keys are the capitals and the values are their respective countries (reverse the mapping)

```python
# Your solution here
```

### Exercise 4: Set Operations

Given two sets:
```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
set_b = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}
```

Perform the following operations:
1. Find the union of set_a and set_b
2. Find the intersection of set_a and set_b
3. Find the elements that are in set_a but not in set_b
4. Find the elements that are in either set_a or set_b, but not in both (symmetric difference)
5. Check if set_b is a subset of set_a
6. Create a new set containing numbers from 1 to 15 and check if it's a superset of both set_a and set_b

```python
# Your solution here
```

## Intermediate Data Structure Applications

2. Add at least 3 contacts with their details
3. Write a function that prints all contacts in a formatted way
4. Write a function to search for a contact by name
5. Write a function to search for contacts by any field (email, phone, or address)
6. Update a contact's information
7. Delete a contact

```python
# Your solution here

### Exercise 6: Dictionary of Lists

Create a program to manage a small library:

1. Create a dictionary where keys are book categories (e.g., 'fiction', 'science', 'history') and values are lists of books in those categories
2. Each book should be a dictionary with 'title', 'author', and 'year' keys
3. Add at least 3 categories with 2-3 books each
4. Write a function to add a new book to a category
5. Write a function to find all books by a specific author
6. Write a function to find all books published before a given year
7. Create a function that returns all books sorted by year

```python
# Your solution here
```

### Exercise 7: List and Tuple Processing

Implement a function to analyze student exam scores:

1. Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student's name and their score in an exam
2. Write a function to calculate the average score
3. Write a function to find the highest and lowest scoring students
4. Write a function to group students by score ranges (A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: below 60)
5. Sort the list by scores in descending order

```python
# Your solution here
```

### Exercise 8: Set Applications

Implement a function to analyze text:

1. Write a function that takes a string and returns a set of all unique words in it
2. Write a function that takes two strings and returns a set of words that appear in both
3. Write a function that takes two strings and returns a set of words that appear in either one but not both
4. Write a function that counts how many unique words are in a text
5. Write a function that identifies the top 5 most common words in a text (hint: use a dictionary to count occurrences)

```python
# Your solution here
```

## Advanced Comprehensions and Combined Data Structures

### Exercise 9: Advanced List Comprehensions

Solve the following problems using list comprehensions:

1. Create a list of all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 or 5
2. Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and its cube, for numbers from 1 to 10
3. Flatten a list of lists into a single list
4. Filter out all vowels from a string and return a list of the remaining characters
5. Create a list of the first letter of each word in a sentence, but only if the word is longer than 3 characters

```python
# Your solution here
```

### Exercise 10: Dictionary and Set Comprehensions

Solve the following problems using dictionary and set comprehensions:

1. Create a dictionary mapping numbers from 1 to 10 to their square roots
2. Create a dictionary where keys are words in a sentence and values are their lengths
3. Create a set of all characters that appear in a string (case-insensitive)
