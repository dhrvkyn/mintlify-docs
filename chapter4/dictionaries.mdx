# Dictionaries

Dictionaries are one of Python's most powerful and versatile data structures. Unlike sequences (like lists and tuples) that store items in a specific order, dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, allowing you to quickly retrieve values based on their associated keys. This mapping structure makes dictionaries incredibly efficient for lookup operations and data organization.

## Dictionary Basics

### Creating Dictionaries

Python offers several ways to create dictionaries:

```python
# Empty dictionary
empty_dict = {}
empty_dict_alternative = dict()

# Dictionary with initial key-value pairs
student = {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science",
    "gpa": 3.8
}

# Using dict() constructor with keyword arguments
person = dict(name="Bob Johnson", age=25, job="Developer")

# Creating a dictionary from a list of tuples
items = [("apple", 0.99), ("banana", 0.59), ("orange", 0.79)]
prices = dict(items)

# Dictionary comprehension (we'll cover this in detail later)
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}  # {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

### Dictionary Keys and Values

Dictionary keys must be hashable (immutable) objects, such as strings, numbers, or tuples (containing only hashable objects). Common key types include:

```python
# String keys (most common)
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Number keys
codes = {200: "OK", 404: "Not Found", 500: "Server Error"}

# Tuple keys (must contain only immutable objects)
coordinates = {(0, 0): "Origin", (1, 0): "East", (0, 1): "North"}

# Mixed keys
mixed = {"name": "Alice", 42: "The answer", (1, 2): "Coordinate"}
```

Values, on the other hand, can be any Python object:

```python
# Dictionary with various value types
employee = {
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"],
    "contact": {"email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "555-1234"},
    "active": True,
    "salary": 75000.50
}
```

### Accessing Dictionary Values

You can access dictionary values using their keys:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science",
    "gpa": 3.8
}

# Access values using square bracket notation
name = student["name"]  # "Alice Smith"

# If you try to access a key that doesn't exist, you'll get a KeyError
# missing = student["address"]  # KeyError: 'address'

# To avoid errors, use get() which returns None if the key doesn't exist
address = student.get("address")  # None

# You can provide a default value to be returned if the key doesn't exist
address = student.get("address", "Not specified")  # "Not specified"
```

### Modifying Dictionaries

Dictionaries are mutable, so you can add, update, or remove key-value pairs:

```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}

# Adding a new key-value pair
student["major"] = "Computer Science"

# Updating an existing value
student["age"] = 21

# Multiple updates with update()
student.update({"gpa": 3.8, "year": "Sophomore"})
print(student)  
# {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 21, 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8, 'year': 'Sophomore'}
```

### Removing Items from Dictionaries

There are several ways to remove items from a dictionary:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science",
    "gpa": 3.8,
    "year": "Sophomore"
}

# Remove a specific key-value pair and return the value
age = student.pop("age")  # age = 20, key-value pair is removed

# Remove and return the last inserted key-value pair
last_item = student.popitem()  # ("year", "Sophomore") in Python 3.7+

# Delete a key-value pair without returning anything
del student["major"]

# Clear all items from the dictionary
student.clear()  # student is now {}
```

## Dictionary Operations

### Checking if a Key Exists

You can check if a dictionary contains a specific key using the `in` operator:

```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "major": "Computer Science"}

has_name = "name" in student  # True
has_gpa = "gpa" in student  # False

# Check if a key doesn't exist
missing_gpa = "gpa" not in student  # True
```

### Dictionary Methods

Dictionaries come with several useful methods:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science",
    "gpa": 3.8
}

# Get all keys
keys = student.keys()  # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'major', 'gpa'])

# Get all values
values = student.values()  # dict_values(['Alice', 20, 'Computer Science', 3.8])

# Get all key-value pairs as tuples
items = student.items()  # dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 20), ('major', 'Computer Science'), ('gpa', 3.8)])
```

Note that `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` return special dictionary view objects, which:
- Are dynamic (reflect changes to the dictionary)
- Support iteration, membership testing, and length calculation
- Can be converted to lists with `list()`

```python
# View objects are dynamic
keys = student.keys()
print(keys)  # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'major', 'gpa'])
student["year"] = "Sophomore"
print(keys)  # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'major', 'gpa', 'year'])

# Convert to a list if you need a static snapshot
keys_list = list(student.keys())
```

### Iterating Through Dictionaries

There are several ways to iterate through dictionaries:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science",
    "gpa": 3.8
}

# Iterate over keys (default)
for key in student:
    print(key)

# Explicitly iterate over keys
for key in student.keys():
    print(key)

# Iterate over values
for value in student.values():
    print(value)

# Iterate over key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### Dictionary Comprehensions

Dictionary comprehensions provide a concise way to create dictionaries:

```python
# Basic dictionary comprehension
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# With conditions
even_squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0}
# {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64, 10: 100}

# From existing dictionaries
prices = {"apple": 0.99, "banana": 0.59, "orange": 0.79}
discounted = {fruit: price * 0.8 for fruit, price in prices.items()}
# {'apple': 0.792, 'banana': 0.472, 'orange': 0.632}

# From other iterables
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
prices = [0.99, 0.59, 0.79]
fruit_prices = {fruit: price for fruit, price in zip(fruits, prices)}
# {'apple': 0.99, 'banana': 0.59, 'orange': 0.79}
```

## Advanced Dictionary Techniques

### Nested Dictionaries

Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values, allowing you to create complex, nested data structures:

```python
# Nested dictionary
employee = {
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "position": "Senior Developer",
    "contact": {
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "phone": "555-1234",
        "address": {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "city": "Boston",
            "state": "MA",
            "zip": "02108"
        }
    },
    "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"],
    "projects": [
        {"name": "Website Redesign", "status": "Completed"},
        {"name": "Database Migration", "status": "In Progress"}
    ]
}

# Accessing nested values
email = employee["contact"]["email"]  # "alice@example.com"
city = employee["contact"]["address"]["city"]  # "Boston"
first_project = employee["projects"][0]["name"]  # "Website Redesign"

# Safely accessing deeply nested values with get()
mobile = employee.get("contact", {}).get("mobile")  # None
```

### Default Values with `defaultdict`

The `collections` module provides `defaultdict`, a dictionary subclass that calls a factory function to provide default values for missing keys:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# defaultdict with list as the default factory
word_counts = defaultdict(int)
for word in "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".split():
    word_counts[word] += 1

print(word_counts)
# defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'the': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog': 1})

# defaultdict with list as the default factory
fruit_categories = defaultdict(list)
fruits = [("apple", "red"), ("banana", "yellow"), ("apple", "green"), ("orange", "orange")]
for fruit, color in fruits:
    fruit_categories[fruit].append(color)

print(fruit_categories)
# defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'apple': ['red', 'green'], 'banana': ['yellow'], 'orange': ['orange']})
```

### Ordered Dictionaries with `OrderedDict`

Before Python 3.7, dictionaries didn't guarantee key order. `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module maintains keys in the order they were inserted:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

# Create an OrderedDict
ordered = OrderedDict([
    ("first", 1),
    ("second", 2),
    ("third", 3)
])

# Keys are returned in insertion order
print(list(ordered.keys()))  # ['first', 'second', 'third']

# Regular dictionaries also maintain order in Python 3.7+
regular = {"first": 1, "second": 2, "third": 3}
print(list(regular.keys()))  # ['first', 'second', 'third']

# The main advantage of OrderedDict is that it treats order as significant for equality comparison
# Two OrderedDicts with the same items but different order are NOT equal
```

**Note:** As of Python 3.7, regular dictionaries maintain insertion order as a language feature. However, `OrderedDict` still has some advantages, such as considering order in equality comparisons and having special methods like `move_to_end()`.

### Counter Dictionaries

The `collections` module also provides `Counter`, a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Count occurrences of elements
colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green", "blue", "blue"]
color_count = Counter(colors)
print(color_count)  # Counter({'blue': 3, 'red': 2, 'green': 1})

# Count words in a text
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
word_count = Counter(text.split())
print(word_count)  # Counter({'the': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog': 1})

# Most common elements
print(word_count.most_common(2))  # [('the', 2), ('quick', 1)]

# Update the counter
word_count.update(["fox", "fox", "dog"])
print(word_count)  # Counter({'fox': 3, 'the': 2, 'dog': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1})

# Arithmetic operations
counter1 = Counter(a=3, b=1)
counter2 = Counter(a=1, b=2)
print(counter1 + counter2)  # Counter({'a': 4, 'b': 3})
print(counter1 - counter2)  # Counter({'a': 2})
```

### Memory-Efficient Dictionaries with `ChainMap`

`ChainMap` from the `collections` module groups multiple dictionaries together to create a single view:

```python
from collections import ChainMap

defaults = {"theme": "dark", "language": "en", "font_size": 12}
user_settings = {"theme": "light"}

# Instead of updating or merging dictionaries
settings = ChainMap(user_settings, defaults)

print(settings["theme"])  # "light" from user_settings
print(settings["language"])  # "en" from defaults
print(settings["font_size"])  # 12 from defaults

# Changes to underlying dictionaries are reflected in the ChainMap
user_settings["font_size"] = 14
print(settings["font_size"])  # 14 from user_settings
```

## Dictionary Performance

Dictionaries are designed for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. When you need to associate values with keys and quickly retrieve them, dictionaries often provide the best performance:

- Lookups by key are O(1) on average (constant time)
- Insertions and deletions are also O(1) on average
- This is much faster than searching in lists or tuples, especially as the collection grows

However, dictionaries require more memory than lists or tuples to store the same data, due to the hash table implementation.

## Common Dictionary Patterns

### Merging Dictionaries

In Python 3.9+, you can use the `|` operator to merge dictionaries:

```python
defaults = {"theme": "dark", "language": "en"}
user_settings = {"theme": "light", "notifications": True}

# Merge with | (Python 3.9+)
settings = defaults | user_settings
print(settings)  # {'theme': 'light', 'language': 'en', 'notifications': True}

# In-place merge with |= (Python 3.9+)
defaults |= user_settings
print(defaults)  # {'theme': 'light', 'language': 'en', 'notifications': True}
```

For earlier Python versions, you can use the `update()` method or unpacking with `**`:

```python
# Using update()
defaults = {"theme": "dark", "language": "en"}
user_settings = {"theme": "light", "notifications": True}
merged = defaults.copy()
merged.update(user_settings)
print(merged)  # {'theme': 'light', 'language': 'en', 'notifications': True}

# Using dictionary unpacking
merged = {**defaults, **user_settings}
print(merged)  # {'theme': 'light', 'language': 'en', 'notifications': True}
```

### Grouping Data

Dictionaries are perfect for grouping related data:

```python
# Group students by major
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "major": "CS", "gpa": 3.8},
    {"name": "Bob", "major": "Math", "gpa": 3.6},
    {"name": "Charlie", "major": "CS", "gpa": 3.5},
    {"name": "Diana", "major": "Biology", "gpa": 3.9}
]

by_major = {}
for student in students:
    major = student["major"]
    if major not in by_major:
        by_major[major] = []
    by_major[major].append(student)

print(by_major)
# {'CS': [{'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'CS', 'gpa': 3.8}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'major': 'CS', 'gpa': 3.5}],
#  'Math': [{'name': 'Bob', 'major': 'Math', 'gpa': 3.6}],
#  'Biology': [{'name': 'Diana', 'major': 'Biology', 'gpa': 3.9}]}

# More concisely with defaultdict
from collections import defaultdict

by_major = defaultdict(list)
for student in students:
    by_major[student["major"]].append(student)
```

### Caching and Memoization

Dictionaries are excellent for caching function results to avoid redundant calculations:

```python
# Basic caching with a dictionary
def fibonacci(n, cache={}):
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    if n <= 1:
        result = n
    else:
        result = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    cache[n] = result
    return result

print(fibonacci(35))  # Fast because of caching
```

A more robust approach is to use the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator, which uses a dictionary-like structure internally:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(35))  # Fast because of caching
```

### Dictionary as a Switch/Case Alternative

Python doesn't have a built-in switch/case statement (prior to Python 3.10), but dictionaries offer an elegant alternative:

```python
def perform_operation(operation, a, b):
    operations = {
        'add': lambda x, y: x + y,
        'subtract': lambda x, y: x - y,
        'multiply': lambda x, y: x * y,
        'divide': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else "Error: Division by zero"
    }
    
    # Get the function for the operation, or a default function
    operation_function = operations.get(operation, lambda x, y: "Error: Invalid operation")
    
    # Call the function with the arguments
    return operation_function(a, b)

print(perform_operation('add', 5, 3))       # 8
print(perform_operation('multiply', 5, 3))  # 15
print(perform_operation('power', 5, 3))     # "Error: Invalid operation"
```

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a function that merges two dictionaries. If both dictionaries have the same key, the value from the second dictionary should overwrite the value from the first.

2. Write a function that inverts a dictionary, making the values the keys and the keys the values. Handle the case where multiple keys have the same value.

3. Implement a word frequency counter that reads a text file and creates a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are the number of times each word appears in the file.

4. Create a simple contact management system using dictionaries. The system should allow adding, removing, and searching for contacts.

5. Implement a function that groups a list of dictionaries by a specified key. For example, grouping a list of student dictionaries by their major.

6. Create a function that finds the most common word in a text, ignoring common stop words (like "the", "a", "an", etc.).

7. Implement a simple cache decorator using dictionaries that stores the results of a function based on its arguments to avoid recalculation.

## Summary

Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure in Python, providing an efficient way to store and retrieve key-value pairs. Their ability to associate values with keys makes them ideal for a wide range of applications, from simple data storage to complex data transformations.

Key points to remember:

- Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs
- Keys must be immutable and hashable (strings, numbers, tuples of immutable objects)
- Values can be any Python object
- Dictionary lookups, insertions, and deletions are very fast (O(1) average complexity)
- Dictionaries maintain insertion order since Python 3.7
- The `collections` module provides specialized dictionary variants (`defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, `Counter`, `ChainMap`)
- Dictionary comprehensions offer a concise way to create dictionaries
- Dictionaries are perfect for tasks like counting, grouping, caching, and implementing lookup tables

In the next section, we'll explore sets, another dictionary-based data structure that stores unique elements and supports powerful set operations.
