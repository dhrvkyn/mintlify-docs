# Comprehensions

Comprehensions are one of Python's most elegant and powerful features. They provide a concise way to create lists, dictionaries, and sets by transforming and filtering data from existing iterables. In this section, we'll explore the different types of comprehensions, their syntax, common patterns, and best practices.

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions allow you to create lists in a single line of code, replacing traditional loops and making your code more readable and often more efficient.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
[expression for item in iterable]
```

This creates a new list by evaluating the expression for each item in the iterable.

### Simple Examples

```python
# Create a list of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# Create a list of uppercase letters from a string
letters = [char.upper() for char in 'hello']
print(letters)  # ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']

# Convert a list of strings to integers
string_numbers = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
numbers = [int(num) for num in string_numbers]
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Adding Conditions

List comprehensions can include conditions to filter elements:

```python
# Syntax with a condition
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Examples:

```python
# Only include even numbers
even_numbers = [x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Only include words with more than 3 letters
words = ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps']
long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) > 3]
print(long_words)  # ['quick', 'brown', 'jumps']

# Filter out None values
values = [1, None, 2, None, 3, 4, None]
valid_values = [x for x in values if x is not None]
print(valid_values)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Nested List Comprehensions

You can nest list comprehensions for working with multi-dimensional data:

```python
# Create a matrix (2D list)
matrix = [[i * j for j in range(1, 4)] for i in range(1, 4)]
print(matrix)  # [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]

# Flatten a matrix
flat = [element for row in matrix for element in row]
print(flat)  # [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9]

# Transpose a matrix (swap rows and columns)
transposed = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]
print(transposed)  # [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]
```

### Conditional Expressions in List Comprehensions

You can use conditional expressions (ternary operators) within list comprehensions:

```python
# Syntax with conditional expression
[true_expression if condition else false_expression for item in iterable]
```

Examples:

```python
# Replace negative numbers with zero
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6]
replaced = [x if x > 0 else 0 for x in numbers]
print(replaced)  # [1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0]

# Categorize numbers as 'even' or 'odd'
numbers = range(1, 6)
categorized = ['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in numbers]
print(categorized)  # ['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']
```

## Dictionary Comprehensions

Dictionary comprehensions allow you to create dictionaries in a similar concise manner.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a dictionary comprehension is:

```python
{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}
```

### Simple Examples

```python
# Create a dictionary of squares
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)  # {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# Create a dictionary from a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruit_lengths = {fruit: len(fruit) for fruit in fruits}
print(fruit_lengths)  # {'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}

# Convert keys to uppercase
original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
uppercase = {k.upper(): v for k, v in original.items()}
print(uppercase)  # {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
```

### Adding Conditions

Just like list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions can include conditions:

```python
# Only include even numbers
even_squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_squares)  # {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64, 10: 100}

# Filter dictionary entries based on values
scores = {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 75, 'Charlie': 82, 'David': 65}
high_scores = {name: score for name, score in scores.items() if score >= 80}
print(high_scores)  # {'Alice': 95, 'Charlie': 82}
```

### Creating Dictionaries from Two Lists

You can use `zip()` with a dictionary comprehension to create dictionaries from pairs of lists:

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
people = {name: age for name, age in zip(names, ages)}
print(people)  # {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}
```

### Swapping Keys and Values

One common use case is swapping keys and values in a dictionary:

```python
original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
inverted = {v: k for k, v in original.items()}
print(inverted)  # {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
```

Note: This only works correctly if the values in the original dictionary are unique and hashable.

## Set Comprehensions

Set comprehensions create sets using similar syntax to list comprehensions.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a set comprehension is:

```python
{expression for item in iterable}
```

### Simple Examples

```python
# Create a set of squares
squares = {x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)  # {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}

# Extract unique letters from a string
text = "hello world"
unique_letters = {char for char in text if char.isalpha()}
print(unique_letters)  # {'e', 'h', 'd', 'l', 'o', 'r', 'w'}

# Create a set of word lengths
words = ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox']
lengths = {len(word) for word in words}
print(lengths)  # {3, 5}
```

### Adding Conditions

Like other comprehensions, set comprehensions can include conditions:

```python
# Only include even numbers
even_squares = {x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_squares)  # {4, 16, 36, 64, 100}

# Create a set of divisors of 100
divisors = {i for i in range(1, 101) if 100 % i == 0}
print(divisors)  # {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100}
```

## Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but create generators instead of lists. They're more memory-efficient because they generate items on-the-fly rather than creating the entire collection at once.

### Basic Syntax

The syntax is the same as list comprehensions, but with parentheses instead of square brackets:

```python
(expression for item in iterable)
```

### Simple Examples

```python
# Create a generator of squares
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1, 11))
print(squares_gen)  # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>

# Iterate over the generator
for square in squares_gen:
    print(square, end=' ')  # 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100

# Sum of squares using a generator expression
squares_sum = sum(x**2 for x in range(1, 11))
print(squares_sum)  # 385

# Convert a generator to a list if needed
numbers_gen = (x for x in range(1, 6))
numbers_list = list(numbers_gen)
print(numbers_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Memory Efficiency

Generator expressions are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as they don't store all values in memory at once:

```python
# Using a list comprehension (stores all values in memory)
import sys
squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(10000)]
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(squares_list)} bytes")  # ~ 87,616 bytes

# Using a generator expression (generates values on-the-fly)
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(10000))
print(f"Generator size: {sys.getsizeof(squares_gen)} bytes")  # ~ 112 bytes

# The generator is much more memory efficient!
```

## Common Patterns and Techniques

### Transforming Data

Comprehensions are excellent for transforming data from one form to another:

```python
# Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
fahrenheit = [((9/5) * c + 32) for c in celsius]
print(fahrenheit)  # [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]

# Extract data from complex structures
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]
names = [person["name"] for person in people]
print(names)  # ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

### Filtering Data

Comprehensions make it easy to filter data based on conditions:

```python
# Filter a list
numbers = list(range(1, 21))
multiples_of_3 = [x for x in numbers if x % 3 == 0]
print(multiples_of_3)  # [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]

# Filter a dictionary
scores = {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 75, 'Charlie': 82, 'David': 65, 'Eve': 90}
grades = {name: 'A' if score >= 90 else 'B' if score >= 80 else 'C' if score >= 70 else 'D'
          for name, score in scores.items()}
print(grades)  # {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'C', 'Charlie': 'B', 'David': 'D', 'Eve': 'A'}
```

### Combining Data Sources

Comprehensions can work with multiple data sources:

```python
# Cross product of two lists
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
sizes = ['small', 'medium', 'large']
products = [(color, size) for color in colors for size in sizes]
print(products)
# [('red', 'small'), ('red', 'medium'), ('red', 'large'),
#  ('green', 'small'), ('green', 'medium'), ('green', 'large'),
#  ('blue', 'small'), ('blue', 'medium'), ('blue', 'large')]

# Dictionary from two parallel lists
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
name_to_age = {name: age for name, age in zip(names, ages)}
print(name_to_age)  # {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}
```

### Working with Strings

Comprehensions are useful for text processing:

```python
# Split a text into words and count their lengths
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
word_lengths = {word: len(word) for word in text.split()}
print(word_lengths)
# {'The': 3, 'quick': 5, 'brown': 5, 'fox': 3, 'jumps': 5, 'over': 4, 'the': 3, 'lazy': 4, 'dog': 3}

# Extract all vowels from a text
vowels = {char for char in text.lower() if char in 'aeiou'}
print(vowels)  # {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
```

### Building Data Structures

Comprehensions are great for constructing complex data structures:

```python
# Create a lookup table
ascii_lookup = {chr(i): i for i in range(65, 91)}  # ASCII for A-Z
print(ascii_lookup)  # {'A': 65, 'B': 66, ..., 'Z': 90}

# Create a matrix
matrix = [[i * j for j in range(1, 4)] for i in range(1, 4)]
print(matrix)  # [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]

# Create a set of tuples
coordinate_points = {(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)}
print(coordinate_points)
# {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
```

## Best Practices

### Readability vs. Complexity

Comprehensions should make your code more readable, not less. If a comprehension becomes too complex, it's better to use a traditional loop:

```python
# Good: Simple and readable comprehension
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

# Bad: Overly complex comprehension
complex_result = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x**3 if x % 3 == 0 else x for x in range(20) if x > 5 and x < 15]

# Better: Use traditional loops for complex logic
result = []
for x in range(6, 15):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        result.append(x**2)
    elif x % 3 == 0:
        result.append(x**3)
    else:
        result.append(x)
```

### Performance Considerations

Comprehensions are generally faster than equivalent for loops, but the difference is often negligible for small data sets:

```python
# List comprehension vs. for loop
# For small data sets, the difference is minimal
# For large data sets, comprehensions are usually faster

import time

# Using a list comprehension
start = time.time()
squares1 = [x**2 for x in range(10000)]
comp_time = time.time() - start

# Using a for loop
start = time.time()
squares2 = []
for x in range(10000):
    squares2.append(x**2)
loop_time = time.time() - start

print(f"Comprehension time: {comp_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Loop time: {loop_time:.6f} seconds")
```

For memory efficiency, prefer generator expressions over list comprehensions when you only need to iterate through the results once:

```python
# Memory-efficient processing of a large range
sum_of_squares = sum(x**2 for x in range(1000000))  # Uses minimal memory
```

### When to Use Each Type of Comprehension

Choose the right type of comprehension based on your needs:

- **List Comprehensions**: When you need an ordered collection that can contain duplicates
- **Set Comprehensions**: When you need unique elements and don't care about order
- **Dictionary Comprehensions**: When you need key-value pairs
- **Generator Expressions**: When you're dealing with large data sets and want to process items one at a time

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Modifying the iterable within the comprehension**:

```python
# Wrong: This can lead to unexpected behavior
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[numbers.append(x) for x in numbers]  # Don't do this!

# Better approach
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers += [x for x in numbers]  # Creates a new list first
```

2. **Using comprehensions for side effects**:

```python
# Wrong: Using a comprehension just for side effects
[print(x) for x in range(5)]  # Don't do this!

# Better approach
for x in range(5):
    print(x)
```

3. **Creating unnecessarily complex comprehensions**:

```python
# Too complex for a comprehension
result = [(x, y, x*y) for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0
                       for y in range(10) if y % 3 == 0
                       if x*y > 10]

# More readable with traditional loops
result = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 != 0:
        continue
    for y in range(10):
        if y % 3 != 0:
            continue
        if x*y > 10:
            result.append((x, y, x*y))
```

## Practical Examples

### Data Analysis

```python
# Calculate statistics from data
data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "salary": 50000},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "salary": 60000},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "salary": 70000},
    {"name": "David", "age": 40, "salary": 80000},
    {"name": "Eve", "age": 45, "salary": 90000},
]

# Extract specific fields
names = [person["name"] for person in data]
total_age = sum(person["age"] for person in data)
average_salary = sum(person["salary"] for person in data) / len(data)

print(f"Names: {names}")
print(f"Total age: {total_age}")
print(f"Average salary: ${average_salary:.2f}")

# Group by age bracket
age_brackets = {
    "20s": [p["name"] for p in data if 20 <= p["age"] < 30],
    "30s": [p["name"] for p in data if 30 <= p["age"] < 40],
    "40s": [p["name"] for p in data if 40 <= p["age"] < 50],
}
print(f"Age brackets: {age_brackets}")
```

### Text Processing

```python
# Analyze a text
text = """
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.
"""

# Count word frequencies
words = text.lower().split()
word_frequencies = {word: words.count(word) for word in set(words)}
print("Top 5 most common words:")
for word, count in sorted(word_frequencies.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]:
    print(f"  {word}: {count}")

# Find all words containing a specific letter
words_with_z = {word for word in set(words) if 'z' in word}
print(f"Words containing 'z': {words_with_z}")

# Create a dictionary mapping words to their first letter
first_letter_map = {word: word[0] for word in set(words) if word}
print(f"First letter map (sample): {dict(list(first_letter_map.items())[:5])}")
```

### Working with Files

```python
import os

# List all Python files in a directory
python_files = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.endswith('.py')]
print(f"Python files: {python_files}")

# Create a dictionary mapping file names to their sizes
file_sizes = {f: os.path.getsize(f) for f in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isfile(f)}
print(f"File sizes (bytes): {file_sizes}")

# Find all directories
directories = [d for d in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isdir(d)]
print(f"Directories: {directories}")
```

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a list comprehension that creates a list of tuples (number, square, cube) for numbers from 1 to 10.

2. Create a dictionary comprehension that maps each word in a sentence to the number of vowels it contains.

3. Use a set comprehension to find all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by both 2 and 3.

4. Write a nested list comprehension to create a multiplication table (a list of lists) for numbers 1 through 5.

5. Create a dictionary comprehension that groups words from a list by their length.

6. Use a generator expression to calculate the sum of squares of all odd numbers from 1 to 100.

7. Create a comprehension that filters out all vowels from a string and returns the remaining characters as a new string.

## Summary

Comprehensions are a powerful and elegant feature of Python that allow you to create lists, dictionaries, and sets in a concise and readable way. They're particularly useful for transforming, filtering, and combining data from existing collections.

Key points to remember:

- List comprehensions create lists: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`
- Dictionary comprehensions create dictionaries: `{key: value for item in iterable if condition}`
- Set comprehensions create sets: `{expression for item in iterable if condition}`
- Generator expressions create generators: `(expression for item in iterable if condition)`
- Comprehensions are generally more concise and faster than equivalent for loops
- Use generator expressions for memory efficiency when dealing with large data sets
- Keep comprehensions simple and readable – if they become too complex, use traditional loops

In the next section, we'll explore advanced data structure techniques, including combining different data structures and solving common problems with the right data structures.
